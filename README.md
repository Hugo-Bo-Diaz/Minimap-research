# Theory about minimaps

## What is a minimap?

A minimap is a representation of the part where the player is on the game universe that is part of th HUD. It usually takes a top-down perspective, unless the game requires otherwise.

## Minimap vs map

The main difference between a minimap and a map is whether they are the main focus of the player when they are on screen, a map is designed usually to make the player observe the world around them before making a decision, therefore not only are usually bigger but centered so that is catches the atention of the player.
"expresion to make it look like i know english", A minimap is an element that should not take the center of the screen as they are more like a constant hint of what is going on the whole map of the game so that the player can always be orientated/aware,

## Micro game vs Macro game

Micro game refers to the gameplay that is skill-based, like managing units or making the input for a shoryuken, this gameplay can be executed correctly without taking in consideration the larger scale of the game.

Macro game, on the other hand, refers to the awareness of the player about his/her surroundings and what is happening on the game on a larger scale and how he/she reasons the information to get a decision.

A minimap can help diferentiate these two types of gameplay to the player as well as making it easier to go from one to another, it will provide macro information but what is displayed on screen usually correspond to the micro game therefore it help balance them a little bit better than only giving the player the option to open a map which can be more difficult to the more inexperienced players.
